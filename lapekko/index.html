        <p>I had some spare computer parts after upgrading my PC. I decided to make a laptop out of them.
        First I had to figure out how to power it with low voltage, which would be easy to get from a battery pack.
        I found a LR1106 PSU that needs 11.2-12.6V. Perfect! I hooked it up to 12V from a normal ATX power supply to test it out.</p>
        <img src="img/breadboard-firstpower.jpg" />
        <p>Later I got a dedicated 12V PSU for further testing:</p>
        <img src="img/12vpsu.png" />
        <img src="img/12vpsu2.png" />
        <p>Then I had to figure out how to get a laptop screen to work with a desktop motherboard.
        I bought a screen and a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/353098860892">controller board</a> from ebay.
        The screen didn't light up at all, and after banging my head against a wall, I figured out that the backlight wasn't connected. So I plugged it in and saw this:</p>
        <img src="img/broken_screen.jpg" />
        <p>So I bought another screen and hoped for the best.</p>
        <img src="img/working_screen.jpg" />
        <p>I've also been experimenting with Gentoo Linux to try to reduce the power consumption, but it hasn't led to anything.</p>
        <img src="img/gentoo.jpg" />
        <p>Now I had to make it run on batteries.
        I got some 18650 cells from old laptop batteries, bought a charger and borrowed capacity tester from a friend.</p>
        <img src="img/cell_testing.jpg" />
        <p>I bought a cheap spot welder and connected 16 of the largest capacity cells together to make a 4S4P pack.</p>
        <img src="img/spot_welding.jpg" />
        <img src="img/spot_welding2.jpg" />
        <p>Then I bought a BMS and connected it to the battery pack. I also connected a thermal fuse and glued it to the battery pack with a thermal glue.
        I'm not sure if it was necessary, but I guess extra safety can't hurt.</p>
        <img src="img/bms.jpg" />
        <p>I bought a <a href="https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002999307370.html">buck converter</a> to convert 13-16.8V from the battery pack to 12V to power the computer.
        Then I run it on batteries for the first time:</p>
        <img src="img/battery_powered.jpg" />
        <p>Now it was the time to make an enclosure. First, I made a prototype out of cardboard to find out the right dimensions.
        I also found an old tablet case with a USB keyboard that was small enough for this project.</p>
        <img src="img/cardboard.jpg" />
        <img src="img/cardboard2.jpg" />
        <p>I also used two xiaomi vacuum robot battery cases for my battery.</p>
        <img src="img/battery_case.jpg" />
        <p>Then I started working on a metal case. I found out that I could make it out of two ATX power supply cases.
        I used rivets for permanent connections and threaded rivets so I could open the case later.
        I also salvaged a screen frame from a broken laptop.</p>
        <img src="img/metal.jpg" />
        <img src="img/metal2.jpg" />
        <img src="img/metal3.jpg" />
        <p>I also experimented with a dedicated GPU, but eventually gave up because it would make the laptop too large.</p>
        <img src="img/gpu.jpg" />
        <img src="img/gpu2.jpg" />
        <p>Then I connected everything together.</p>
        <img src="img/case.jpg" />
        <img src="img/finished.jpg" />
        <p>One thing that was missing was the power supply switchover (which would allow me to power the laptop from a 20V wall charger) and a built-in battery charger.
        For this whole time I was charging the battery using a bench power supply, which wasn't very convenient.
        I made a circuit using a LTC44122 IC for the power switchover and bought a CC CV buck converter for battery charging.
        I've adjusted its output voltage a bit lower than the maximum 16.8V so it wouldn't overcharge the cells.
        I also added legs to the case for better air intake.</p>
