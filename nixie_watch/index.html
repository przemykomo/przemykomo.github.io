        <h1>Nixie watch</h1>
        <img src="img/showcase.png" />
        <p>Ever since I've learned about nixie tubes I wanted to make a watch out of them. They just look so awesome.
        So when I found an ebay listing for 6 IN-16 tubes I had to buy them. When I got them I made a 555 step-up on a breadboard to get 170V required for nixies.</p>
        <img src="img/tube_test.png" />
        <p>Looked great, so I made a circuit with an attiny MCU and TPIC6B595 shift registries
        (can't use ordinary shift registries since low side voltage on nixies can float up to 50V!) on a breadboard,
        soldered the step-up as a separate module and tested that everything worked when powered from two Li-Ion batteries.</p>

        <p>Then I made a complete clock circuit with DS1307 RTC on a breadboard and made sure it's working.</p>

        <p>It was time to solder everything and make it somewhat compact.</p>

        <p>Needless to say, it was a mess and didn't work. I had to design a custom pcb.</p>

        <p>This time I got it work. A chunky brick on my wrist.</p>

        <p>I wanted to make it smaller, so I designed a new pcb with SMD components.
        Only after I got the pcb I realized that the ATtiny412 I planned to use uses proprietary programming interface (UPDI)
        which I could not get to work.
        So I did some dodgy soldering to use ATtiny25 with different pinout on my board.</p>

        <p>I also got the case 3D printed.</p>
        <img src="img/case.jpg" \>
        <p>Then I only had to put everything together. Since my measurements weren't precise I had to melt some plastic in the case
        to make room for the nixies. I realized that only after I broke one tube and had to replace it.</p>
